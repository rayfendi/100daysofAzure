## Ray's Cloud Journey

My name is Ray, and I am a 8+ year professional of the IT industry working as a systems administrator/engineer and IT Specialist. I've primarily worked in the Microsoft space with technologies like Active Directory, Exchange, ITIL, & SCCM. Lately I've been helping companies move to Microsoft 365, primarily using Microsoft Teams for collaboration purposes. 

I've started this challenge as a way to organize what I am doing to expand my skillset outside of the Microsoft ecosystem. I'm working towards a career as an Azure Cloud or DevOps engineer. I've already achieved several Azure certifications including:

- Azure Administrator Associate
- Azure Architect Expert

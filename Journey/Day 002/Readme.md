I'm currently performing a onboarding process for an organization. I will be using Windows OS to perform this task. I'm going to navigate to Azure Active Directory to manage devices, and configure self-service password reset.

## Prerequisite

An Azure Premium P1 license and administrator permissions to manage devices and updates, and configure SSPR.

## Instructions
